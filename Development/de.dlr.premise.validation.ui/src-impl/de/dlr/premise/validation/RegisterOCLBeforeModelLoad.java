/**
 * Runs OCLRegistration, which registers the {@link ResourceSetAwarePivotModelManager} for use with the pivot OCL environment. See
 * {@link ResourceSetAwareOCLDelegateDomainFactory} for details.
 * 
 * Note: In earlier versions, this was only done in the {@link Startup}. But when the workbench is opened with an editor being restored, the
 * code initializing the editor will run before {@link Startup} is actually executed in this project. In this case, the wrong DelegateDomain
 * is used to create the InvocationDelegates. InvocationDelegates are stored in static final fields in the model XYZImpl classes, so it's
 * impossible to change them later on.
 * 
 * By running this BeforeModelLoad, we make sure that the InvocationDelegate fields have not yet been accessed.
